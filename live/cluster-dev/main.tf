# cluster-dev — the EKS dev cluster.
#
# §2: "Separate clusters for dev and prod is not negotiable." Namespace-only
# separation shares a control plane, a CNI, and every cluster-scoped resource —
# so a bad admission webhook or a CRD upgrade reaches production. $73/month buys
# real isolation and it is the cheapest isolation available.
#
# One component is exempt and it is stated rather than hidden: ARGOCD REACHES BOTH
# CLUSTERS BY DESIGN. It runs in prod and manages dev remotely (§5b), which is the
# conventional hub-and-spoke arrangement and how a deployer has to work. The
# isolation above is therefore "no shared control plane EXCEPT the deployer".
#
# ⚠ BLOCKED ON THE RESIDENCY ANSWER. `infra/docs/data-residency-question.md` must
# be answered before this is applied. Answer C — all Vietnamese personal data must
# stay in Vietnam — means a different CLOUD PROVIDER, not a different region, and
# AWS has no Vietnam region. Creating clusters first is the one sequence that
# cannot be recovered from cheaply (§18).
